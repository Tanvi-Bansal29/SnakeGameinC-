# SnakeGameinC++

The **Snake Game** is a classic console-based game implemented in C++. In this game, the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, collecting food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with itself or the screen boundaries. The game features simple ASCII graphics and is designed to demonstrate basic game logic and mechanics.

#### **Key Features**
- Single-player gameplay with real-time controls.
- Dynamic score tracking based on food collected.
- Incremental difficulty as the snake grows.
- Simple console-based visuals using characters.

#### **Purpose**
This project highlights core programming concepts such as:
- Input handling.
- Game loops and state management.
- Collision detection.
- Basic graphics with console output.

It's an excellent project to showcase problem-solving and C++ programming skills on GitHub.
